UI
- Mobile Friendly
- Responsive
- 4 Rows of players
- There will be 18 total columns that needs to be condensed down to 9

Functionality
+ load API data
- Option of Selecting between multiple courses
    - For some reason it has it implied we will have to create most of our HTML 
    in JS which to me doesn't make much sense when we are simply displaying 
    information
- 4 Rows of players
- player objects
    - Needs name, id, scores
- Drop down menu to swap courses

How to
- fetch function to get data we need (like 4 lines of code per row)
